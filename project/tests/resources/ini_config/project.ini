# GENERAL RULES
# =============
#
# * All folder/file names should be:
#       - lowercase
#       - seperated by '_'
#       - matching the regrex [a-z0-9_]+ with the exeception of the system
#         dependent file/folder seperator

[DEFAULT]
# Note that these are both abstracted from this configuration file to allow
# for this file to be pushed to a public remote without having the paths and
# passwords stored inside these files made public.
