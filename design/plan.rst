1. init
    #. separate all of the JSON roots
        * folders, files, project, git, sync
    #. create temp dir
    #. create sync & temp mapping locations
        - simple *boolean* map::

            true (include):  ["PATH", ""]
            false (exclude): ["PATH", ""]
    #. turn project name into symbol
        Use as folder name!

2. make folders
    * work with **temp**

    #. loop through all of the folders
        a. generate dir
        b. generate sub dir
        c. parse git strategy
            * map to valid location

3. make files
    * always generated files
        - License
            > imported from resources
            > possible to fetch from an online repo
        - Contributors
        - README
            * Generation?
            * Should it be auto generated? If so, through what mechanism
            should the user be able to add text during creation?
    * loop through all of the *non-autogenerated* files
        #. init file
        #. (optional) generate header
        #. (optional) import text
            * from URL/path
        #. parse git strategy
            * map to valid location
    * put the XML config file in resources!

4. un-temp
    * copy to actual location
    *

5. git
    #. define/generate gitignore
    #. commit to master
    #. set upstream
    #. push to master
    #. loop through all branches
        a. generate
        b. set-upstream
        c. push

5. sync
    * sync to all locations
    * generate sync export for sync application
