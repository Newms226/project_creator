Sprint - Git & writing to files
==================================

[x] research into python & git!
    [x] strategy for knowing what is/isn't going to the repo
[x] .gitignore creation
[] deal with nested git ignores (tree structure?)
[] REPOS!
[] auto generate of a git-repo if none is passed in!
[] define auto-branches
[] create separate git repo to sync to (back up)
[] import a specific .gitignore template

[] write header / text to a file
[] abstract out the file creation to util/files.py


Future Features:
----------------
- auto import year / contributors into the license doc
- pull license from some online repo
- integration with file sync
- reorganize a folder to fit a spec
- generate dir hierarchy from a command (ex: maven)
- generate XML from a specific project hierarchy
    > Useful to copy an entire hierarchy from one location to the next
    > Useful to build testing dirs from src dirs
- import not only files, but entire folders
